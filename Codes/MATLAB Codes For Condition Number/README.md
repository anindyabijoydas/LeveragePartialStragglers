Here MATLAB codes are provided to find the worst case condition number for different types of codes. The caption of the files will help to understand the job of the program. For example, "matrix_vector_condition_no_convolutional_code.m" provides the worst case condition number using convolutional codes over n workers and s stragglers for matrix-vector multiplication. There are some helping functions like "khatrirao.m", "shiftrow.m", "matrix_vector_best_mat.m" or "matrix_matrix_best_mat.m".
